The original, accept no substitutes! These 1-inch stickers are the best way to passive-aggressively insult your friends (or enemies, or perfect strangers). Use them when someone <a href="https://www.xkcd.com/562/">parks their car badly</a> or on your pupils (the learning kind, please don't put these on your eyes). We recommend carrying a few stickers (they come pre-cut) in your wallet so you're always ready for an insult with more gravitas than your typical sad trombone or slow clap.<br><br>
The ironically high-quality image is printed on glossy sticker paper<a class="hlink" id="gloss-back" href="#gloss">*</a>. The rounded star shape works better in sticker form than the original pointed star.

<ul id="footnotes">
 <li id="cars"><a class="hlink" href="#cars-back">*</a> These stickers have a paper backing instead of the waterproof vinyl of bumper stickers, making them harder to remove from cars - which may be an upside if you're using them on someone else.</li>
 <li id="gloss"><a class="hlink" href="#gloss-back">*</a> They have a glossy finish, but the gradient design is printed with plain old ink (they aren't as shiny as gold foil). If we sell enough of these stickers, we can buy the gold foil and CNC vinyl cutter we need to make waterproof, shiny, golden stickers. But in the meantime, these stickers still serve their main function passive-aggressively insult people at a lower price.</li>
